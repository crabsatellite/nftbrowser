# NFT Browser

## Overview

NFT Browser is a web application designed to provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface for browsing Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). The application is built with React and is designed to be lightweight, responsive, and easy to use.

You can demo it [here](https://master.d3lcrvsygn5gex.amplifyapp.com/).

## Features

- **Browse NFTs:** The main feature of the application is the ability to browse various NFTs. The application provides a clean and simple interface for users to navigate through the NFTs.

- **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to be responsive and works well on a variety of devices and screen sizes.

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

- `npm run eject`: Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back! If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
